import Underlining from "../../../../src/styles/underlining"

Portfolio with projects descriptions distributed across repositories. CI/CD pipeline configured to download all projects descriptions before build and deployment.
This feature allows creating description for portfolio inside project repository where it belongs.
Major motivation for developing this project was to have some fun with CI/CD pipelines.
Used <Underlining highlight><a href="https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">this Gatsby template</a></Underlining>. Design of this portfolio page <Underlining highlight>DOES NOT</Underlining> belong to me.
